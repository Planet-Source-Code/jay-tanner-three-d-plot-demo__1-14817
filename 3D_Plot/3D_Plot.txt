A simple 3D plotting demo program written by Jay Tanner

This is a simple demo of the raw methodology involved in
the basics of plotting 3D points on a 2D monitor screen.

All this simple program does is compute the image of a cube
one point at a time with a circle drawn on the front face.

Anyone who wants to learn the elementary math involved in
plotting a point in 3D space onto a 2D monitor can study the
source and experiment with various viewpoint settings in the
interface to see how they interrelate and effect things.

Each of the X,Y,Z axes are color coded as RGB respectively
help to keep track of the image orientation.


Many comments in the code explain what each part does.
